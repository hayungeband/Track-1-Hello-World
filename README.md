Track-1-Hello-World
===================

The first track of hayungeband's github album.

Programming for the client is so boring. Why we don't make some lines of code for fun? Hayu ngeband lah (in English: Let's make a band).

I'm using ChucK programming language for this track. If you don't know what ChucK is, you can learn and download from [its site](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu). I include the sample output audio file from the first script :)

How To Participate?
===================
Easy just clone this repository, and code another instrument. I'll merge your code to the repository. Let's jam with the code ^^
